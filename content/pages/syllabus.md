Listening assignments are the focus of 21M.250. You are expected to listen to each assignment before and/or after each class. Listening, as demonstrated in class participation, is worth 40% of your grade. Consequently attendance is expected at all classes. If you miss a class you are required to submit at the following class a one page listening report on the material covered in the missed class.

It is strongly recommended that you purchase this text and scores. Additional scores will be distributed during the class.

It is also suggested that you read or at least skim the appropriate entries for the given composers in the _New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians_.

Exams
-----

The class will include two quizzes, each 90 minutes long. They will cover the concepts presented and the music assigned during one-half of the semester. They represent 40% of your grade. **There is no final exam.**

Concert Reports
---------------

Concert reports constitute the written component of the class. Three are required, and each is expected to be about 5 pages long. Reports I and II are due no later than Lec #14, while the third and final report is due by Lec #24. I suggest that you hand in reports early and often, and it is critical that you write up the report very soon after having attended the concert, recital, ballet or opera. I expect that at least one of the concerts occur "off-campus" and that at least two involve professional musicians. It is rare for a concert to feature only Romantic music, however those you choose to write about should present at least one major work by a composer in our syllabus. It never hurts to check with me about the appropriateness of an event before hand. Please note that neither collegiate a cappella nor "Cats" falls within the purview of this class.

Composers: A Handy Chronology
-----------------------------

1770 -1827 Ludwig van Beethoven

Although will not "officially" study him, all 19th century music is essentially a response to his towering achievement. Beethoven remains the model of the 'Romantic" genius, and both the miniature and colossal strains of 19th century music are dependant on his example. Remember that Liszt as a child prodigy was kissed by him, Wagner thought he was almost as great as Wagner himself, and Schumann hailed the unfortunate young Brahms has his heir. Only at the end of the century could Debussy simply be indifferent to him.
